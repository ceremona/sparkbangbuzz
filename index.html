<h3>Zinc Negative Resistance Oscillator.</h3>
Anyone can make an active semiconductor device at home by heating galvanized sheet metal.  With it, simple rf and audio oscillators can be built.  Amplifiers can also be built.  With a carbon microphone or transformer connected, the rf oscillator can even transmit audio to a nearby am radio.  Really!! I'm not kidding.

<h3>Zinc Negative Resistance Crystal Oscillators and Zinc 80 Meter CW Transmitter.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/zinc-osc-2/zinc-osc3.htm">Zinc Negative Resistance Crystal Oscillators.<a>
<p>This is a continuation of my first article on zinc negative resistance oscillators made from the simple homemade zinc negative resistance diode.
<p>In the early 1920's Oleg Losev in Russia experimented with negative resistance oscillators and circuits using zincite.  One of the main problems was that usable zincite came from only one place in the world - New Jersey.  
<p>My articles are about doing very similar experiments using heat treated galvanized sheet metal.  I believe Losev would have been very excited if he had been able to try heat treated galvanized sheet metal as a substitute for zincite and it may very well work even better.

<h3>Homemade Zinc Oxide Detector Diode.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/zinc-oxide-diode/zinc-oxide-diode.htm">Zinc Oxide Detector Diode.<a>

<h3>Homemade Memristor.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/memristor/memristor.htm">Homemade Memristor.<a>
<p>A homemade memristor was made from pieces of brass, copper or lead that had been turned to a dark color from exposure to sulfur.

<h3>Homemade Copper Oxide Thermoelectric Generator Can Light An LED.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/copper-oxide-te/copper-oxide-gen3.htm">Homemade Copper Oxide Thermoelectric Generator.<a>
<p>Simple homemade copper oxide thermoelectric generator can be made from two pieces of copper wire.  A single junction can generate more than 300 millivolts when heated with a flame.  Sixteen of these in series can light an LED.

<hr>
<h3>Thermocouple Made From Ordinary Copper And Steel Wire.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/thermocouple/thermocouple.htm">Copper And Steel Thermocouple.<a>

<hr>
<h3>Homemade Magnetic Audio Amplifier using toroids found in parts box.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/mag-audio-amp/mag-audio-amp.htm">Homemade Magnetic Audio Amplifier.<a>
<p>An audio amplifier can be built without using any tubes or transistors.     

<hr>
<h3>Homemade FET Transistor Made From Cadmium Sulfide Photoresistor.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/cds-fet/cds-fet.htm">FET Transistor Homemade From Cadmium Sulfide Photocell.<a>
<p>A common cadmium photoresistor (called photocell in the text) was made into a crude insulated gate field effect transistor.  Definite transistor action was observed after improvising a gate on the photocell.  Even though the voltage gain was small, a considerable amount of power gain was produced.


<hr>
<h3>Corona Oscillator And Corona Triode.</h3>
<p><a href="http://sparkbangbuzz.com/corona-osc/corona-osc.htm">Corona Oscillator And Corona Triode.<a>
<p>A pin point near a flat positive high voltage plate forms an oscillator that produces pulses roughly in the AM broadcast band frequency range.  A control element near the pin point can control the overall current and frequency.  This makes a triode that exhibits gain.

<hr>
<h3>"Easy Ten" A simple 80 Meter CW Transmitter Using A 2N3904.</h3>
A very simple 80 meter CW one transistor QRP transmitter made from a common npn transistor, two resistors, two capacitors, a 3.5 - 4 mhz crystal and a 9v battery.  I call this transmitter "The Easy Ten" because it can be easily heard from a distance of over ten miles.
<p>This article includes some good basic philosophy on antennas.

<hr>
<h3>Flame Triode With Gain.</h3>
I have found a simple way to make a triode with gain using an alcohol flame.  This flame triode exhibits both power gain and voltage gain.  By making a flame dual triode, I have been able to make a free running multivibrator oscillator and code practice oscillator.
<p>I also observed a very intriguing phenomenon of flame electrical conductivity; that electrons from a cathode, placed inside of the flame, can flow to the anode even when the anode appears to be placed well outside of the flame.

A simple homemade wide range variable electrolytic capacitor using baking soda can vary in capacitance in one continuous sweep over a 5000 to 1 range.  This capacitor can vary the frequency of a simple relaxation oscillator over a similar range.  Even the zinc negative resistance oscillator can be continuously swept over the entire audio range.

Do you get more thrust by blowing air out a tube than you would get in the negative direction by sucking the same amount of air into the tube???

I have always been fascinated with the old Arc transmitters of the early

period of wireless radio.  Not to be confused with Spark Gap transmitters,
