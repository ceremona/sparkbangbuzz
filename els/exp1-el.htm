        This bomb is made from a 2 liter bottle and uses Compressed Air

instead of dry ice.  It can be set off in a relatively safe manner

because it is filled and set off through a long hose.  This project

requires a small initial investment to procure the hose, meter,

fittings, etc. but eliminates the necessity of buying dry ice.

Dry ice is often times sold in minimum amounts of $10.00 or more,

limiting the fun to times when dry ice happens to be around.

<p>



        The pipe fittings should be the metal type and the hose should

be of high pressure type rated at 250 psi or greater.  The project is

simply a 2 liter bottle connected to a pump and meter through a long

hose.  For construction, the pictures are self explanatory.  The meter

is not absolutely nessary, but is desirable when you want to know how

close your are to <h4>BOOOOOOMMMMMM!!!!!!.</h4>

<p>



        If you cannot get quite enough pressure from your pump to burst

the bottle (125 to 150 psi), you can set it off by shooting it with a

powerful BB or pellet gun.  The pressure usually has to be 100 psi or

greater for the bottle to burst when the BB hits; otherwise, the

compressed air will just hiss out the hole without exploding.

<p>



Other kinds of containers besides 2 liter pop bottles can work

well.  Containers made of light plastic material would seem to be

the best choice as far as flying debris is concerned.  We got an

enoumous bang from a cylinrical shaped "Head &amp Shoulders" flexible

plastic shampoo bottle.  It blew at only 50 psi but made enough

noise to make one wonder what the neighbors were going to do.
