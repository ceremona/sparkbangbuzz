<h1>Sound Amplitude Modulated Laser Beam.</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Most Laser Pens can easily be adapted to send a sound amplitude
modulated beam.  The ones that use the pocket clip as a switch are
the easiest to use for this purpose, but the ones with a button
can still be used but not quite as conveniently. 
<p>With the modulated Laser Beam, a signal can easily be sent
many many times farther than what can easily be done with the 
modulated LED.
<p>The trick to modulating a laser is to put a 10 ohm resistor in 
series with the batteries and couple a sound signal across the 
resistor through a 100 uf capacitor from an 8 ohm audio source.  
The source can be the earphone output of a small amplifier driven by
a microphone or the earphone output of a small transistor radio.  
<p>
The kind of laser pen that uses the pocket clip
as the switch is the easiest to use since the circuit can be 
connected to a small piece of two sided copper clad PC board 
material.  The PC board material can then be easily slipped under
the clip.  This puts the circuit in series with the laser power
supply (batteries).
<p>
The kind of laser pen that has a button in the side can also be
used but you will need to remove the back end of the laser pen
and connect the circuit between the center battery terminal
and the laser body.  A bit of tape and ingenuity etc. will be
required.  The button on the side of the laser can then be held
closed with a piece of tape or rubber band around the laser.

Warning:
The signal should be very low level as it is may be possible 
to blow the laser with too much signal input.  The right amount of
signal will sound very soft when driving just the radio speaker 
but will be enough to modulate the laser well.  The light from the 
laser should flicker only slightly when modulated.
<hr>
<p>
The receiver can simply be a photocell plugged into a small audio 
amplifier.  Both are available at Radio Shack.  They have a tiny
palm sized audio amplifier.  This type of amp could also also be 
used to drive the laser transmitter from a microphone.
