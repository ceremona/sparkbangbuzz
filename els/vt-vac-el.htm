<title>Vacuum tube operation at amateur grade vacuum.</title>



<h1 align=center><b>Vacuum tube operation at amateur grade vacuum.</b>

<p>

<hr>



<h4 align=left>Updated 8 June 2000.

<p>

I have found that a vacuum tube can operate at a vacuum 

level easily attainable by amateurs.  We certainly are not talking about 

optimum performance, but rather an experiment to satisfy a life long 

curiosity about how high of vacuum is required to make a vacuum tube operate. 



<p>

I had a couple of 5965 (equivalent to 12AV7) dual triode tubes and opened

one to the atmosphere, let air inside and then attached a hose

for connection to a vacuum pump.  As the picture below shows, it was

a simple operation.  Notice how the normally mirror like getter (at the top

of the tube) is now powdery white from being attacked by the air.  It took 

roughly 30 minutes for the bright silvery film to turn white after breaking the

seal on top of the tube. 

<p>

The hose was glued on top of the tube with hot glue.  The other end

of the hose was attached to a 1/4" flare adapter with hot glue.

Many sizes of clear vinyl hose such as that used here will collapse

from atmospheric pressure.  I used one with a thich enough wall to

withstand atmospheric pressure.

The hot glue was a very handy way to go and it seemed to adhere well enough

to the glass.  It was surprising how long I could run the tube without 

melting the hot glue.  It actually never melted, but I was careful not 

to run the tube for long periods.



<p>

The pump that I used is an old Robinair refrigeration service pump. 

I don't know how well hot glue is suited for high vacuum connections, but 

The pump is capable of getting down to 10 microns or below according to 

a Supco thermister vacuum gauge.  A small degree of vacuum tube operation was

observable at pressures as high as 1 torr but as expected, the tube worked much better

at lower pressures of about 50 microns and below.  Most of the experimenting

described here was done at around 50 microns and below.  When the 

vacuum was close to 10 microns, I would turn on the filament and notice an

immediate climb in pressure from the hot filament outgassing.  After several

times of heating, however the vacuum would stay down.

<p>



The first attempt of observing vacuum tube operation was to connect the cathode

and plate to an old Tecktronix 575 curve tracer.  The grid was connected so

that I could connect it to either the cathode, the plate or a biasing pot connected

to a 9 volt battery.  This tube is a double triode with a center tapped filament.

This allowed operation of just one triode with 6 volts applied to one of the filaments.

With the normal 6 volts across the filament, no glow 

was seen because of the air inside keeping it cool.  As the pump was turned on, the

filament started to glow, but maybe not quite so brightly as normal.  Changes in current

drain from the filament were very noticeable as the degree of vacuum changed and thus 

changed the temperature and resistance of the filament.  This was observed simply by

having a volt meter across the filament and watching the voltage change from a varying

load.  With a given voltage applied to the filament one might be able to build a good 

vacuum gauge by using a vacuum tube connected to a bridge circuit and a meter.

<p>



In order to observe any vacuum tube action at all, It was necessary to run

the filament voltage much higher than normal - about 10 to 12 volts.

According to the indications on the curve tracer, the tube seemed to be operating

to a reasonable degree.  One certainly would not expect full spec operation under

these types of conditions.  With 100 volt sweep on the plate and a 20k resistor, I was 

easily able to get a plate voltage change of about 40 volts from a 3.5 volt

bias change on the grid.  That seems to indicate a very usable amount of 

amplification.

</p>



<p>

The next step was to put my home evacuated tube to the real test by connecting it into 

an actual circuit such as an amplifier or oscillator.  I did just that and had no 

difficulty in making a Hartley type broadcast band oscillator run with 9 volts applied

to the filament.  See schematic A.  As the oscillator ran, I would turn off the vacuum 

pump and watch the oscillator signal on an oscilloscope as the pressure rose.  

Unbelievably, I could keep the oscillator running as the pressure 

rose to as high as one torr (1000 microns).  The filament voltage had to be raised to 

11 volts in order to keep it going at this pressure.  The oscillator signal was 

much weaker at one torr, but it is fascinating that it could run at such high pressure 

in the tube.

<p>

I also connected it into an amplifier configuration and varied the grid input voltage

swing while watching the plate voltage swing.  See schematic B.  I measured a voltage 

gain of about 15 or 16, a definitely usable gain.



<p>

Transconductance measurements were made using schematic C.  The tube plate output 

current curve reflects positive as well as negative grid voltage.  I only 

made transconductance measurements between zero and minus grid voltage.  In this 

range the tube generally drew about 1 ma plate current using 100 volt plate supply.  

That didn't seem bad for a homepumped vacuum tube.  Varying the grid voltage 

between minus 1.265 volts and minus .679 volts (.586 volt change) caused the plate 

current to vary from .5 ma to 1.5 ma.  This calculated to be a transconductance of 

about 1700 micromhos.



<p>

It may also be possible to make a vacuum gauge by measuring the plate conductance to 

the tube.  Perhaps a versatile gauge could be made for two different ranges of vacuum 

by using the filament heat transfer method for one range and the plate conductance 

change method for another range.



<p>

The use of vacuum tubes, under the conditions described above, is a very adverse

condition for the filaments.  Four filaments became history in the course of the above 

experimentation.



<p>

I hope soon, to try making a homemade vacuum tube completely from scratch.  Even if 

it's operation is crude and has to have the pump running during its operation, it will 

be a very satisfying experience.  It is something I have thought about all my life.

The experiments described above make prospects for a crude homemade vacuum tube quite

encouraging.
