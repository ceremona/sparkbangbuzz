<h1 align=center>Refrigerator charged with propane.</h1>

<hr>

<blockquote><b><i>Again, There is no intention here to imply that

any of the procedures discussed here are safe, legal or even 

sane.  I take no responsibility for what anyone may do with

this information.  The &%$^#@ environmentalists have made  the

process of refrigeration into a big Three Ring Circus.  The 

regulations that they have brought about

are so stringent that one should never underestimate the ease

of being a criminal when involved with any refrigeration

process.  Yes, There are high pressures involved, and I know 

that propane (R 290) is flammable and explosive and that there 

are many reasons that a system of this nature may not always be suitable 

for domestic uses.  So Please spare me from letters and 

comments about my stupidity.  This is not a plan for a 

practical, safe, reliable refrigerator.  It's sole purpose was 

to observe a working refrigeration process using materials 

obtained from the nearest hardware store.  The materials used 

are crude by refrigeration standards and the possibility of 

leaks are high, making this a project to strongly consider 

being done out of doors.

        Many old refrigerators that used R-12 can be charged with propane from 

the hardware store and work just fine.  One such refrigerator (shown below), 

converted by someone who will remain nameless, can easily freeze enough water to 

pass the real test - that of producing enough ice to make a

batch of home made ice cream.  Eight quarts of water were turned to ice overnight.

<p>



  Some of the differences encountered when doing this are:

<p> 

1.  Propane operates at a higher pressure and the pump must be able to 

produce it.  Most pumps will do that.  The high side pressure will

typically be 100 psig higher than with R-12

<p>

2.  The temperatures from the evaporating coil may be different enough to

disrupt proper operating of the thermostat since most systems sense the

temperature of the evaporator coil.  This can be taken care of

by making a duty cycle timer or an inside air temp sensor.  At the time

of this writing, this has not been worked out.  So far, the refrigerator

has been operated by manually turning it on and off.  It seems to have no

trouble running for many hours at a time.  

<p>

3.  The capillary tube (expansion valve in previous project) may not have the 

optimum resistance.  All cases tried so far have worked quite well.  If not,

a simple, and so far very satisfactory, expansion valve can be made by pinching

a piece of copper tube.  This must be done while watching meters to get it just

right.  Approx 15 psig seems to work well.  The freezing of ice mentioned above 

was done using a pinched tube.  The pinched tube has been operating very 

consistantly on an ocasionally used system.

<p>

4.  And of course, propane is flammable.  There are vary widely varying 

opinions about this.  Many believe the risk is minimal and are trying

to promote the use of hydrocarbon refrigerants.  Propane for example, 

is an excellent refrigerant. 

<p>

The standard 1/4 flare fittings and torch soldering seem to work well for 

making connections in a system such as this.

Note the buildup of frost on the return tube all the way to the pump.

<p>

This replaced the capillary tube which was removed.  This was done mostly

to see if it would work.  The original capillary tube seemed to also work ok.

This is where the high pressure liquid refrigerant shoots into the low pressure

side and evaporates to become very cold.  Notice how the low pressure side is 

completely covered with frost.
