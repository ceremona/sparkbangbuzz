# This is a github mirror of http://sparkbangbuzz.com 
## The brilliant experiments of Nyle Steiner, who creates complex physical phenomena using commonly available materials.

It has been a minute (several years) since any new material has been added to the original site, so I wanted 
to archive his fantastic experiments for posterity.  (Hoping Nyle is still alive and kicking, but I am honestly not so sure).  
I created this mirror site out of concern that the original site may, one day, dissappear.  
This is a (static) mirror site.  
Additional work and documenation from him can be found at:

**_Know that this mirror was created out of respect and admiration for Nyle's work with no intention to take credit for his work._**
