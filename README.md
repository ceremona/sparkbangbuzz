## The experiments of Nyle Steiner, who creates brilliant complex physcial phenomena using only basic materials.

It has been a minute (several years) since any new material has been added to the original site, so I wanted 
to archive his fantastic experiments for posterity.  (Hoping Nyle is still alive and kicking).  
I created this mirror site out of concern that the original site may, one day, dissappear.  
This is a (static) mirror site of sparkbangbuzz.com, created from the brilliant experimentation and documenation of Nyle Steiner.  
Additional work and documenation from him can be found at:

**_Know that this mirror was created out of respect for Nyle's work with no intention to take credit._**
